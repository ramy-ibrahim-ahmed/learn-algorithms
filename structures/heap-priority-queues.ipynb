    "- Heaps are a variant of the typical binary tree with special condition that each node must be smaller than its childs no matter else.\n",
    "\n",
    "- This intoduce the priority of things as we pop we get the min and the heap handle rearrange itself in *O(log n)* as it just need to go throw one path in the tree.\n",

    "Standard liberary for work with heaps, It just provide the min type of heaps.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `heapify` we use this func to convert a list into a heap in Time: O(n) and Space: O(1) due to swapping, we start from the last parents and compare them with their childs to keep the min values as the last parents then we go furthur on top, when present heap in an array structure we can access the childs by the index of the *(parent * 2) + 1*.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- `heappush` we can insert an element in the heap with *O(log n)* due to insert the element and in the wrost case it will be down in a single path till the end childs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `heappop` we can pop the top node which is the minimum of the heap and assign it to a variable with also *O(log n)* due to go in a single path to adjust the heap after pop the most top node its min child will be the top node and its path will be adjusted.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `heappushpop` we can pop the min element and push a new one in the same operation and adjust the heap in a single operation after the two actions with also *O(log n)*.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `peak heap` we can peak the minimun value without pop it in *O(1)* because the firts node is the min."
